10. **cat** (Concatenate and Display):
    - Displays the contents of a text file.
    - Example: `cat file.txt`

11. **less** or **more**:
    - Allows you to view the contents of a text file one page at a time.
    - Example: `less file.txt`

12. **head** and **tail**:

13. **grep** (Global Regular Expression Print):
    - Searches for a pattern in files.

    - Example: `chmod permissions file.txt`

15. **chown** (Change Owner):
    - Changes the owner of a file or directory.

These are some of the most commonly used basic Linux commands. Linux offers a wide range of commands, each with its own set of options and functionalities. You can use the `man` command followed by the command name (e.g., `man ls`) to access the manual pages and learn more about each command's options and usage.
